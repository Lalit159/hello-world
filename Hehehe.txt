DOCTOR WALA:

The Answer for your question is given below clearly

From the questionâ€™s text, we can infer the following functional dependencies:

{Doctor#, Patient#, Date}->{Diagnosis, Treat_code, Charge}
{Treat_code}->{Charge}
Because there are no partial dependencies, the given relation is in 2NF already. This however is not 3NF because the Charge is a nonkey attribute that is determined by another nonkey attribute, Treat_code. We must decompose further:

R (Doctor#, Patient#, Date, Diagnosis, Treat_code)
R1 (Treat_code, Charge)

We could further infer that the treatment for a given diagnosis is functionally dependant, but we should be sure to allow the doctor to have some flexibility when prescribing cures
